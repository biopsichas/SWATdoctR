\title{Runs the SWAT+ soft-calibration routine for water balance components.}
\usage{
run_softcal_waterbalance(
  project_path,
  wateryield_ratio,
  baseflow_ratio,
  keep_folder = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{project_path}{Path to the SWAT+ project folder}

\item{wateryield_ratio}{Numeric value between 0 and 1 which defines the
fraction of precipitation which becomes water yield through fast, slow,
and aquifer flow}

\item{baseflow_ratio}{Numeric value between 0 and 1 which defines the
fraction of water yield which is base flow}

\item{keep_folder}{(optional) If \code{keep_folder = TRUE}
'.model_run/verification' is kept and not deleted after finishing model runs.
In this case '.model_run' is reused in a new model run if \code{refresh = FALSE}.
\code{Default = FALSE}}
}
\value{
Returns the simulation results for the soft calibration routine as a
  tibble.
}
\description{
\code{run_softcal_waterbalance} executes the SWAT+ soft calibration
routine to adjust the overall water balance of a SWAT+ model setup.
The user can specify the \code{wateryield_ratio} and the
\code{baseflow_ratio} of the simulated watershed. Based on the provided
ratios the routine adjusts the respective model parameters to improve
the fit of the simulated water balance components to the provided ratios.
